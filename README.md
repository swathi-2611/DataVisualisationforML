Project Description: US Data Analysis of Accidents

Objective: Analyze US accident data from Kaggle to identify key insights regarding accident occurrence, duration, and locations.

Data: Utilize date and time-related attributes to explore accident patterns, sourced from Kaggle.

Methods: Employ bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps for effective data visualization.

Findings: Discover accident trends by month, examine accident durations, and pinpoint high-density accident locations.

Recommendations: Provide actionable insights for authorities to implement targeted safety measures and enhance accident prevention strategies.

Impact: This analysis can improve road safety, potentially saving lives through evidence-based decision-making.

Future Work: Consider predictive modeling for proactive accident prevention in subsequent phases.
